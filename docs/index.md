# Abstract

Sym is a set-driven matrix language for expressing large-scale general 
equilibrium models in algebraic form. It is designed to be nearly as 
concise as standard matrix notation. However, it also imposes rigorous 
conformability rules on all expressions, allowing it to catch a broad 
range of potential errors that could otherwise arise in matrix-driven 
languages. As a result, subscripts are unnecessary in many expressions, 
improving the clarity of a model's code and facilitating documentation 
and maintenance. 

Sym is used to implement G-Cubed, a multi-region general equilibrium model 
of the world economy, and [OpenIGEM](https://pjwilcoxen.github.io/openigem/), 
an open-source econometric general equilibrium model of the US economy.

# Documentation

See [usage](usage.md) for a short usage description for the program, 
including a list of the back-end solution packages that are currently 
supported. See [syntax](syntax.md) for a brief overview of Sym's 
syntax.
